## FAQ

**Q:** Which Extensions for VS Code is Wes using?  
**A:** All my extensions are listed on [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles), but specifically this course uses [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode).
